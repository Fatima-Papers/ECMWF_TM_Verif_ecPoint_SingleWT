### IMPORTANT NOTE!

The contents of the _Data/Raw_ directory do not appear in the repository since are they are not supposed to be re-distributed outside ECMWF. The contents of the _Data/Compute_ directory do not appear in the repository because are too big to be stored in the repository. 

The contents of these two direcotries are available upon request to the repository's main author (see repository's README file for the contact details) and prior approval from ECMWF management.
